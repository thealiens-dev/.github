# Alien Tools

Alien Tools is a collection of tools and experiments developed within The Aliens project.

The focus is on simple and transparent mechanisms that are easy to verify and reason about.

Some tools are connected to the Bitcoin ecosystem, while others explore broader technical ideas.

These tools are provided as-is and iterated over time.
